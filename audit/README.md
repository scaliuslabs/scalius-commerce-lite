# Scalius Commerce Audit

Audit refresh date: 2026-06-13, workspace timezone.

This folder is the working audit system for slice-by-slice remediation. It replaces the older broad report set because several prior findings had become stale, partially remediated, or too vague to hand to future agents safely.

## Files

- [AUDIT_REPORT.md](AUDIT_REPORT.md) - current findings, evidence, stale-claim corrections, and simplification themes.
- [REMEDIATION_TRACKER.md](REMEDIATION_TRACKER.md) - actionable issue list for future fixing agents.
- [VERIFICATION_PLAYBOOK.md](VERIFICATION_PLAYBOOK.md) - commands and manual flows to verify fixes when full local dev is difficult.
- [PORTION_REWRITE_CHECKLIST.md](PORTION_REWRITE_CHECKLIST.md) - the checklist to use when rewriting one portion at a time.
- [AGENT_HANDOFFS.md](AGENT_HANDOFFS.md) - recommended ownership slices and prompts for future agents.
- [STALE_OR_SUPERSEDED_CLAIMS.md](STALE_OR_SUPERSEDED_CLAIMS.md) - old audit claims that should not be repeated without fresh evidence.

## Current Validation Snapshot

- `pnpm typecheck` passes at the repo root.
- `pnpm exec drizzle-kit check --config packages/database/drizzle.config.ts` passes.
- `pnpm test` currently passes: 93 test files and 556 tests.
- Focused storefront Vitest now starts after adding the missing `happy-dom` dev dependency.
- Several hard-to-run flows require Wrangler, queues, Cache API behavior, service bindings, provider sandboxes, or deployed Worker testing.

## How To Use This Folder

1. Pick one tracker item or one coherent domain slice.
2. Read the relevant section in [AUDIT_REPORT.md](AUDIT_REPORT.md).
3. Use [PORTION_REWRITE_CHECKLIST.md](PORTION_REWRITE_CHECKLIST.md) before editing.
4. Add or update focused tests before changing behavior when feasible.
5. Run the smallest meaningful verification from [VERIFICATION_PLAYBOOK.md](VERIFICATION_PLAYBOOK.md).
6. Update [REMEDIATION_TRACKER.md](REMEDIATION_TRACKER.md) with status, owner, commit/PR, and verification evidence.
7. Update `AGENTS.md` only when the fix changes a real convention, architecture rule, command, or limitation.

## Ground Rules

- Do not hand-edit generated files: `apps/admin-v2/src/routeTree.gen.ts` or `packages/api-client/src/generated/**`.
- Do not read or print real `.dev.vars` or `.env.development` contents.
- Preserve unrelated dirty work.
- Treat every old finding as a hypothesis until re-verified against current code.
- Prefer focused remediation over broad refactors. The goal is a codebase that becomes more reliable after each slice.
