## 🛠 Project Architecture

Before diving in, please understand that this is a **hybrid** application:

1.  **Admin Dashboard (Astro + React):** Located in `src/pages/admin` and `src/components/admin`.
2.  **Storefront API (Hono):** Located in `src/server`. This is mounted via an Astro integration.
3.  **Database (Turso/libSQL):** We use Drizzle ORM.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js** (Latest LTS recommended)
*   **pnpm** (We use pnpm for package management)
*   **Turso Account** (or a local SQLite setup)

### Local Setup

1.  **Fork and Clone**
    Fork the repository to your GitHub account, then clone it locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/scalius-commerce-lite.git
    cd scalius-commerce-lite
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables**
    Copy the example environment file (if available) or create a `.env` file based on the README. At a minimum, you need:
    ```env
    TURSO_DATABASE_URL=...
    TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
    PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
    ```

4.  **Database Setup**
    Push the schema to your database:
    ```bash
    pnpm db:generate
    pnpm db:sync
    ```

5.  **Run Development Server**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The app should be running at `http://localhost:4321`.

## 💻 Development Workflow

1.  **Create a Branch**
    Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
    # or
    git checkout -b fix/annoying-bug
    ```

2.  **Make Changes**
    *   **Backend/API:** If modifying the API, work within `src/server`. Remember to update the OpenAPI spec if you change routes.
    *   **Database:** If you change `src/db/schema.ts`, run `pnpm db:generate` to create the migration files.
    *   **Frontend:** We use Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui. Keep components small and reusable.

3.  **Test Your Changes**
    *   Ensure the Admin UI (`/admin`) loads and functions.
    *   Test API endpoints via Swagger UI (`/api/v1/docs`).

4.  **Commit**
    We encourage using **Conventional Commits** messages:
    *   `feat: add new widget builder`
    *   `fix: resolve order calculation error`
    *   `docs: update API documentation`

5.  **Push and Open a PR**
    Push your branch to your fork and submit a Pull Request to the `main` branch of this repository.

## 📋 Coding Standards

*   **TypeScript:** We use TypeScript for everything. Please do not use `any` unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Formatting:** Run `pnpm format` (if available) or ensure your editor uses Prettier.
*   **API Design:** If adding new Hono routes, ensure they are typed and include OpenAPI descriptions in the route definition.
